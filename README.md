# myBarCart

## Welcome

Hello and welcome! MyBarCart is a recipe web app that was built based around a simple query idea. What can I make right now with what I have. Most recipe websites, food or drink, will provide a list of recipes that have some ingredients you're interested in, but more often than not that leads to a grocery store trip to get what your missing. After a long day, I don't always have the energy to make a trip into town to get groceries, so I made this. Enter what you have, and the app will only return recipes you can make right now! Enjoy!

Currently this app is built utilizing a 3rd party API from [thecocktaildb](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/). Make sure to show them some support!
