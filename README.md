# myBarCart

This app is being made to create a utility for those of use who would not like to make a trip to the store. The idea behind this is that by updating an inventory of what you have in your home you will get only recipes that you can make with those ingredients. Nothing extra that you need to go find.

## TO DO

1. Implement Unit testing
2. Implement Integration Testing
3. Implement E2E Testing
4. Remove file method for local storage
5. Implement seperate database for storing recipes
6. Change query system to improve retreival time of recipes
7. Create styling (remove current eye bleach)
8. Convert components to Typescript
